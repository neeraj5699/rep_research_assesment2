Tornados and Floods are the Two Most Harmful Weather Events Across the U.S
Synopsis

The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database and answer two basic questions about severe weather events, starting in the year 1950 and ending in November 2011.

1.Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2.Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

The results show that, in the past 60 years, tornados are most harmful with respect to population health, which have led to 5633 deaths and 91346 injuries and floods have the greatest economic consequences, which have cause over 150 billion dollars economic losses.
Loading and Processing the Raw Data

From the course web site we obtain data tracking charactertistics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage from 1950 to November 2011. There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.
